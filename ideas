So the idea is to have a Django-esque MVC framework written in Io.

Key goals are:
- Lightweight
- Cross DB
  - Within Io, there are already bindings for MySQL, SQLite, SQLite3, and PostgreSQL.
  - Another option here is to play with NoSQL bindings (this would be instead of the above).
- Secure
- Easy to learn
- Well documented
- Django-esque
